In every developer time, there comes a time when he has to set-up his new working environment. For me, the transition from Windows powered PC to a Mac OSX powered laptop was one of the best things i did in my carer. I found the openness of things you can do on a Unix based system accompanied with a solid appealing set of software. 
However, setting everything the way you **want** it can be time consuming, so i decided after few trials and errors to share my experience in customizing my machine and how it can be easily transfered into other machines as well.

## Customizing the UI

First, lets start with the light weight things. The desktop and general UI enhancement. I always love to show some nice widgets on my desktop, for that i am using [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/). I have used [Geektool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) which basically allows you to run custom scripts and display them on the desktop, but i wasn't at all happy with the experience of styling those "widgets" and the availability of 3rd party widgets. 
**Übersicht** lets you run system commands and display their output on your desktop in little containers, called widgets. Widgets are written using HTML5, which means they are:

- Easy to write and customize
- Can show data in tables, charts, graphs ... you name it
- Can react to different screen sizes

There is already a nice set of widgets published in the [gallery](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/). In my `widgets` folder, you will find the set of widgets i am using with customized positioning and styling.
