In every developer time, there comes a time when he has to set-up his new working environment. For me, the transition from Windows powered PC to a Mac OSX powered laptop was one of the best things i did in my carer. I found the openness of things you can do on a Unix based system accompanied with a solid appealing set of software. 
However, setting everything the way you **want** it can be time consuming, so i decided after few trials and errors to share my experience in customizing my machine and how it can be easily transfered into other machines as well.
